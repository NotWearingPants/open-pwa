# open-pwa
A OpenSource Project to research and offer the ability to Port PWA Concepts to any Platform by providing the needed API's to legacy Platforms

## What and Why?
We will research and create a environment agnostic way to run PWA's in browsers that do not support them. we will offer a permission based api and implament all the functionality that chrome offers for a PWA.

so this will be a single daemon or app or server it is not so importent how we name that. It will expose API's that a remote website can call to request a local installation and use of existing Platform features.

The Implamentation will be written in JS the First Prototype will be nodejs based and later we expand it to graalvm to get it even more embedded able while keeping the code understand able by all ECMAScript knowing people,
